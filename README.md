## File Naming Convention

Files have been renamed to follow a consistent naming convention:
- Use lowercase letters and hyphens instead of spaces
- Descriptive names that indicate content and purpose
- Consistent prefixes for related files (e.g., `paper1-`, `resume-`)

## Usage

1. **Resume Development**: Work primarily in the `/resumes/` directory
2. **Academic Work**: Use `/academic-papers/` for research papers and proposals
3. **Reference Materials**: Consult `/research-materials/` for templates and references
4. **Documentation**: Maintain project notes in `/documentation/`
5. **Automation**: Use scripts in `/scripts/` for file management tasks

## Recent Changes

- Reorganized all files into logical directory structure
- Renamed files with descriptive, consistent naming convention
- Created this README for project documentation
- Moved legacy/unclear files to `/archive/` for review
