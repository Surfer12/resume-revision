## Research Goals

I develop and validate interdisciplinary methodologies that bridge cognitive science and artificial intelligence, with a focus on observable, scientifically verifiable measurements and real-world impact. My work is characterized by:

- **Bi-Directional Knowledge Integration:**  
  I design neuro-symbolic AI frameworks where cognitive science informs symbolic reasoning modules, and neural network learning capabilities reciprocally enhance cognitive understanding. My models feature *adaptive integration weights* that dynamically balance interpretability and learning, enabling real-time adaptation to individual cognitive states—a capability not achievable by single-discipline approaches.

- **Methodological Convergence and Validation Authenticity:**  
  My research creates genuine methodological convergence, ensuring that each discipline’s methods transform the other. I employ *multi-dimensional validation protocols* that satisfy both computational efficiency metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference time) and cognitive authenticity measures (e.g., NASA-TLX cognitive load, behavioral pattern fidelity), ensuring solutions are both technically optimal and cognitively meaningful.

- **Dynamic Trade-off Management:**  
  I address and transcend traditional trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. interpretability, efficiency vs. cognitive validity) by developing systems that dynamically adjust their integration strategies based on real-time cognitive load and task demands. This results in *Pareto-optimal solutions* that outperform single-discipline baselines.

- **Empirical Rigor and Transparent Failure Documentation:**  
  My work is grounded in robust experimental design, including power analysis, effect size reporting, and multiple comparison corrections. I document not only successful approaches but also cross-disciplinary failures—attempts that succeed in one domain but fail integration tests—advancing standards for transparency in interdisciplinary science.

- **Translational Impact:**  
  I translate these innovations into practical applications, such as cognitive enhancement tools, educational technology, and human-centered AI systems. For example, my research on modeling surfboard-water interactions with machine learning exemplifies how data-driven insights can optimize both physical design and user experience.

- **Ethical and Open Science Practices:**  
  I prioritize IRB-approved protocols, data privacy, informed consent, and open science practices, including pre-registration and sharing of code and anonymized data.

**Summary Statement:**  
My research agenda is defined by a commitment to creating genuinely novel, co-evolutionary methodologies that neither cognitive science nor AI could achieve alone. By integrating rigorous empirical validation, dynamic adaptation, and transparent reporting, I aim to advance both theoretical understanding and practical solutions for enhancing human cognition and learning.
