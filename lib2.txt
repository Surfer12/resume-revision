 installed) or another conversion tool available in the environment.  
     - Save the output as `Ryan_Oates_Resume.pdf` in the same workspace directory.  
   - Verify that the PDF retains the formatting from the Word document (e.g., no text or layout distortions).

4. **Prepare a LaTeX Version (Optional Deliverable for Academic Use)**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` to create a LaTeX file for the resume/CV, suitable for academic applications where LaTeX is preferred.  
     - Command: `write`  
     - Path: `Ryan_Oates_Resume.tex`  
     - File Text: Use a standard LaTeX resume template (e.g., `moderncv` or `article` class) and input the draft content, adapting it to LaTeX syntax. Ensure sections are properly formatted with LaTeX commands (e.g., `\section{}`, `\subsection{}`, itemize for bullet points).  
   - Use `developer__shell` to compile the LaTeX file into a PDF.  
     - Command: `pdflatex Ryan_Oates_Resume.tex`  
     - Ensure the output `Ryan_Oates_Resume.pdf` (LaTeX version) is saved in the workspace directory.  
   - Note: If LaTeX compilation fails due to missing packages, notify the user of the issue and provide the `.tex` file as is for manual compilation if needed.

5. **Tailoring Guidance for Specific Applications**  
   - Prepare brief guidance notes (as a separate text file or within a comment in the Word document) on how to tailor the resume for different applications:  
     - **Academic Applications:** Emphasize the Research Goals, Publications, and Presentations & Workshops sections. Expand on research projects and methodological rigor. Use the LaTeX or PDF version for submission.  
     - **Industry Applications:** Shorten the Research Goals to the concise version provided in the draft. Highlight Professional Experience and Technical Skills. Focus on practical impacts (e.g., performance improvements, real-world applications). Use the Word or PDF version.  
     - **Grant Applications:** Focus on Research Goals, Translational Impact, and Ethical Practices. Include specific metrics (e.g., improvement percentages) and align with grant objectives. Use the PDF version.  
   - Save this guidance as `Ryan_Oates_Resume_Tailoring_Guide.txt` using `developer__text_editor`.

6. **Add Placeholder for Cover Letter (Optional)**  
   - In the Word document (`Ryan_Oates_Resume.docx`), add a note at the end or in a separate section stating: “Cover Letter can be provided upon request or tailored for specific applications.”  
   - Update the document using `computercontroller__docx_tool` with this addition.

7. **Verify and Save All Deliverables**  
   - Use `developer__shell` to list files in the workspace directory and confirm that `Ryan_Oates_Resume.docx`, `Ryan_Oates_Resume.pdf`, `Ryan_Oates_Resume.tex` (if created), and `Ryan_Oates_Resume_Tailoring_Guide.txt` are saved.  
     - Command: `ls -l`  
   - If any file is missing, repeat the relevant step to recreate it.

8. **Notify User of Completion and Deliverables**  
   - Prepare a summary message for the user indicating that the resume/CV has been finalized in multiple formats:  
     - Word Document: `Ryan_Oates_Resume.docx` (editable, suitable for most applications).  
     - PDF: `Ryan_Oates_Resume.pdf` (for professional submissions).  
     - LaTeX: `Ryan_Oates_Resume.tex` (optional, for academic contexts, with compiled PDF if successful).  
     - Tailoring Guide: `Ryan_Oates_Resume_Tailoring_Guide.txt` (instructions for customizing the resume).  
   - Mention that the resume can be further tailored or expanded (e.g., adding a cover letter or specific awards) upon request.  
   - Use `memory__remember_memory` to store this summary under:  
     - Category: `Resume_Deliverables`  
     - Data: The list of files and summary message.  
     - Tags: `resume, cv, ryan_oates`

**Dependencies:**  
- Step 2 must be completed before Step 3 (Word to PDF conversion).  
- Step 4 (LaTeX version) is optional and can be skipped if LaTeX tools are unavailable or not required; however, attempt it for completeness.  
- Step 7 (verification) relies on successful completion of Steps 2-6.

**Conditional Logic:**  
- If the LaTeX compilation in Step 4 fails due to environment limitations (e.g., missing `pdflatex`), save only the `.tex` file and note in the user summary that manual compilation may be needed.  
- If the user later specifies a preferred format or application type, refer to the tailoring guide created in Step 5 and adjust the relevant document accordingly.

**Final Note for Executor AI:**  
Ensure all files are saved in the user’s workspace directory for easy access. If any tool fails to execute a step (e.g., file creation or conversion issues), document the error and proceed with the remaining steps, notifying the user of any incomplete deliverables. The primary goal is to deliver a polished resume/CV in at least Word and PDF formats, with guidance for tailoring to specific needs.

This plan provides a clear path to finalize Ryan Oates' resume/CV, addressing the user’s request for specific formats and potential customization while leveraging the available tools effectively.

### Step-by-Step Plan for Creating a LaTeX Version of Ryan Oates' Resume

**Context and Objective:**  
The task is to create a LaTeX version of Ryan Oates' resume, focusing on interdisciplinary research at the intersection of cognitive science and computational engineering. This resume is intended for academic applications where LaTeX-formatted documents are preferred for their professional typesetting. The content includes specific sections: Personal Summary, Education, Research Interests, Technical Skills, Personal Projects, Paper Presentations, Personal Approach, and Interests & Activities. The preferred LaTeX class is `moderncv` for its clean, professional layout suitable for CVs, with `article` as an alternative if a more academic style is desired.

**Tools to Use:**  
- `developer__text_editor`: For creating and writing the LaTeX source code file.
- `developer__shell`: For potentially compiling the LaTeX file into a PDF if needed (though guidance on compilation will also be provided to the user).

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Create a New LaTeX File Using `moderncv` Class**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `write` command to create a new file named `ryan_oates_resume.tex`.  
   - Include the basic structure for a `moderncv` document with the theme set to `casual` (or another suitable theme like `classic` or `banking` if preferred).  
   - Add placeholders for all required sections: Personal Summary, Education, Research Interests, Technical Skills, Personal Projects, Paper Presentations, Personal Approach, and Interests & Activities.  
   - Include necessary packages for formatting (e.g., `fontenc`, `inputenc`, `geometry`) and ensure the document is set up for UTF-8 encoding and modern fonts.  
   - **File Content Example (to be written):**  
     ```latex
     \documentclass[11pt,a4paper,sans]{moderncv}
     \moderncvstyle{casual}
     \moderncvcolor{blue}
     \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
     \usepackage{lmodern}
     \usepackage[scale=0.75]{geometry}

     % Personal data
     \name{Ryan}{Oates}
     \title{Curriculum Vitae}
     \address{123 Academic Lane, Research City, RC 45678}

     \makecvtitle

     \section{Personal Summary}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section{Education}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section{Personal Approach}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section{Interests \& Activities}
     % Placeholder for content

     \end{document}
     ```

2. **Populate the LaTeX File with Resume Content**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `str_replace` command to replace the placeholder comments in each section with the actual content from the enhanced resume provided by the user.  
   - Ensure proper LaTeX formatting for lists (`\cvitem`, `\cvlistitem`, or `\begin{itemize}`), dates, and other elements using `moderncv` commands where applicable (e.g., `\cventry` for education or experience entries).  
   - **Note:** If the exact content text is not accessible in the current context, extract it from the user's previous message or request it to be pasted again for accuracy. Format the content appropriately for LaTeX, escaping special characters (e.g., `&`, `%`, `$`) if necessary.  
   - **Dependency:** This step relies on having the exact resume content text. If unavailable, the executor AI should note this and proceed with placeholders, informing the user to fill in the content manually or provide it for updating.

3. **Adjust Layout and Formatting for Academic Suitability**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `str_replace` or `write` command to tweak the `moderncv` style or color scheme if needed (e.g., change to `classic` style for a more formal academic look by replacing `\moderncvstyle{casual}` with `\moderncvstyle{classic}`).  
   - Ensure the layout is clean and professional, adjusting margins or font sizes if necessary using the `geometry` package or other LaTeX commands.

4. **Add Compilation Guidance as a Comment in the File**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool to append a comment at the top of `ryan_oates_resume.tex` with instructions for the user on how to compile the LaTeX file into a PDF.  
   - **Comment Example to Add:**  
     ```latex
     % Compilation Instructions:
     % 1. Use an online LaTeX editor like Overleaf (www.overleaf.com) by uploading this file.
     % 2. Alternatively, install a local LaTeX distribution such as TeX Live (Linux/Mac) or MiKTeX (Windows).
     % 3. Compile the document using a LaTeX editor (e.g., TeXShop, TeXworks) or command line with: pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex
     % 4. Ensure the 'moderncv' package is installed in your LaTeX environment.
     ```

5. **Optional: Attempt Local Compilation (if feasible)**  
   - If the environment supports LaTeX compilation, use the `developer__shell` tool to run a command like `pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex` to generate `ryan_oates_resume.pdf`.  
   - Check for errors in the output and note them for the user if compilation fails (e.g., missing packages).  
   - **Conditional Logic:** If compilation is not supported or fails, skip this step and inform the user that they will need to compile the file themselves using the provided instructions.  
   - **Command Example:** `pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex`

6. **Deliver the LaTeX Source File and Instructions to the User**  
   - Inform the user that the LaTeX source file `ryan_oates_resume.tex` has been created and is ready for use.  
   - If a PDF was successfully generated in Step 5, mention the availability of `ryan_oates_resume.pdf`. Otherwise, reiterate the compilation instructions added in Step 4.  
   - Provide a brief note on how to customize the file further if needed (e.g., changing the `moderncv` theme or adding personal details).

**Additional Notes for Executor AI:**  
- Ensure all special characters in the resume content are properly escaped for LaTeX (e.g., replace `&` with `\&`, `%` with `\%`, etc.).  
- If there are issues accessing the exact content from the user's previous message, note this limitation and leave detailed placeholders with instructions for the user to fill in.  
- If the `moderncv` class is not suitable or unavailable in the user’s LaTeX environment, consider falling back to the `article` class with custom formatting as a secondary option, and update the file accordingly.

The task is to create a LaTeX version of Ryan Oates' resume, focusing on interdisciplinary research at the intersection of cognitive science and computational engineering. This resume is intended for academic applications where LaTeX-formatted documents are preferred for their professional typesetting. The content includes specific sections: Personal Summary, Education, Research Interests, Technical Skills, Personal Projects, Paper Presentations, Personal Approach, and Interests & Activities. The preferred LaTeX class is `article` with custom formatting to achieve a traditional academic CV look, emphasizing clarity and formality suitable for academic purposes.

**Tools to Use:**  
- `developer__text_editor`: For creating and writing the LaTeX source code file.
- `developer__shell`: For potentially compiling the LaTeX file into a PDF if needed (though guidance on compilation will also be provided to the user).

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Create a New LaTeX File Using `article` Class with Custom Formatting**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `write` command to create a new file named `ryan_oates_resume.tex`.  
   - Set up the document using the `article` class with custom formatting to mimic a traditional academic CV. Include packages for better typography (`times` or `palatino` for a formal font), layout control (`geometry` for margins), and section styling (`titlesec` for customized headings).  
   - Define a header with personal information (name, contact details) and create placeholders for all required sections: Personal Summary, Education, Research Interests, Technical Skills, Personal Projects, Paper Presentations, Personal Approach, and Interests & Activities.  
   - **File Content Example (to be written):**  
     ```latex
     \documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{article}
     \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
     \usepackage{palatino} % For a traditional, serif font
     \usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} % Set 1-inch margins for a formal look
     \usepackage{titlesec} % For customizing section headings
     \usepackage{enumitem} % For better list formatting
     \pagestyle{empty} % No page numbers for a CV

     % Customize section headings for a traditional academic look
     \titleformat{\section}{\large\bfseries\raggedright}{}{0em}{}[\hrule]
     \titlespacing{\section}{0pt}{12pt}{6pt}

     % Define personal information header

     ```

2. **Populate the LaTeX File with Resume Content**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `str_replace` command to replace the placeholder comments in each section with the actual content from the enhanced resume provided by the user.  
   - Format the content using appropriate LaTeX structures, such as `itemize` or `description` environments for lists, and ensure dates and other details are aligned consistently for a professional appearance (e.g., using `\hfill` for right-aligned dates).  
   - **Note:** If the exact content text is not accessible in the current context, extract it from the user's previous message or request it to be pasted again for accuracy. Format the content appropriately for LaTeX, escaping special characters (e.g., `&`, `%`, `$`) if necessary.  
   - **Dependency:** This step relies on having the exact resume content. If unavailable, the executor AI should note this and proceed with placeholders, informing the user to fill in the content manually or provide it for updating.

3. **Refine Layout and Formatting for Traditional Academic Style**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `str_replace` or `write` command to ensure the formatting aligns with a traditional academic CV aesthetic. This includes:
     - Using a serif font like Palatino or Times for a formal look.
     - Ensuring section headings are clear and separated by horizontal rules (as defined in Step 1).
     - Adjusting spacing between entries using `enumitem` package settings (e.g., `\setlist[itemize]{itemsep=2pt}`) for a compact yet readable layout.
   - Verify that the document avoids modern or overly stylized elements, focusing on simplicity and professionalism.

4. **Add Compilation Guidance as a Comment in the File**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool to append a comment at the top of `ryan_oates_resume.tex` with instructions for the user on how to compile the LaTeX file into a PDF.  
   - **Comment Example to Add:**  
     ```latex
     % Compilation Instructions:
     % 1. Use an online LaTeX editor like Overleaf (www.overleaf.com) by uploading this file.
     % 2. Alternatively, install a local LaTeX distribution such as TeX Live (Linux/Mac) or MiKTeX (Windows).
     % 3. Compile the document using a LaTeX editor (e.g., TeXShop, TeXworks) or command line with: pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex
     % 4. Ensure necessary packages (palatino, titlesec, enumitem, geometry) are installed in your LaTeX environment.
     ```

5. **Optional: Attempt Local Compilation (if feasible)**  
   - If the environment supports LaTeX compilation, use the `developer__shell` tool to run a command like `pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex` to generate `ryan_oates_resume.pdf`.  
   - Check for errors in the output and note them for the user if compilation fails (e.g., missing packages).  
   - **Conditional Logic:** If compilation is not supported or fails, skip this step and inform the user that they will need to compile the file themselves using the provided instructions.  
   - **Command Example:** `pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex`

6. **Deliver the LaTeX Source File and Instructions to the User**  
   - Inform the user that the LaTeX source file `ryan_oates_resume.tex` has been created and is ready for use, formatted with the `article` class for a traditional academic CV look.  
   - If a PDF was successfully generated in Step 5, mention the availability of `ryan_oates_resume.pdf`. Otherwise, reiterate the compilation instructions added in Step 4.  
   - Provide a brief note on how to customize the file further if needed (e.g., changing the font to `times` by replacing `palatino` with `times` in the preamble, or adjusting margins via the `geometry` package).

**Additional Notes for Executor AI:**  
- Ensure all special characters in the resume content are properly escaped for LaTeX (e.g., replace `&` with `\&`, `%` with `\%`, etc.).  
- If there are issues accessing the exact content from the user's previous message, note this limitation and leave detailed placeholders with instructions for the user to fill in.  
- If specific LaTeX packages (e.g., `palatino`, `titlesec`) are not available in the user’s environment, consider using alternatives (e.g., `times` instead of `palatino`) and update the file accordingly, noting this in the instructions.
