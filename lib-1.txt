   my research on modeling surfboard-water 
  interactions with machine learning 
  exemplifies how data-driven insights can 
  optimize both physical design and user 
  experience.

  - **Ethical and Open Science Practices:**  
    I prioritize IRB-approved protocols, data
   privacy, informed consent, and open 
  science practices, including 
  pre-registration and sharing of code and 
  anonymized data.

  **Summary Statement:**  
  My research agenda is defined by a 
  commitment to creating genuinely novel, 
  co-evolutionary methodologies that neither 
  cognitive science nor AI could achieve 
  alone. By integrating rigorous empirical 
  validation, dynamic adaptation, and 
  transparent reporting, I aim to advance 
  both theoretical understanding and 
  practical solutions for enhancing human 
  cognition and learning.

  ### How This Section Embodies Your Unique 
  Interdisciplinary Approach

  - **Not Just “Interdisciplinary” in Name:**
    
    You demonstrate *methodological 
  convergence*—your work is not simply the 
  sum of two fields, but a new synthesis 
  where each discipline’s methods and 
  standards transform the other.
  - **Bidirectional Integration:**  
    Your frameworks allow cognitive science 
  to shape AI architectures (e.g., symbolic 
  reasoning modules, cognitive-inspired 
  regularization in deep learning) and, 
  reciprocally, use AI to probe and extend 
  cognitive theory.
  - **Multi-Dimensional Validation:**  
    You set a new standard by requiring that 
  your solutions meet both technical 
  (accuracy, efficiency) and cognitive 
  (authenticity, load, behavioral fidelity) 
  benchmarks.
  - **Transparent Failure Reporting:**  
    You document not only technical failures 
  but also “integration failures”—where 
  approaches succeed in one domain but fail 
  when cross-validated against the standards 
  of another. This is a methodological 
  innovation in itself.
  - **Dynamic Trade-off Management:**  
    Your models do not statically balance 
  performance and interpretability; they 
  *adapt* based on real-time cognitive 
  context, a feature not found in traditional
   approaches.
  - **Quantified Synergy:**  
    You provide evidence that your integrated
   approaches achieve performance 
  improvements that exceed the sum of 
  single-discipline optimizations (e.g., 18% 
  improvement in cognitive task performance 
  vs. 3–8% for single-discipline models).
  - **Ethical and Open Science Leadership:** 
   
    You foreground IRB approval, data 
  privacy, and open science, positioning 
  yourself as a leader in responsible, 
  transparent research.

  ## Research Goals

  I develop and validate interdisciplinary methodologies that
   bridge cognitive science and artificial intelligence, with
   a focus on observable, scientifically verifiable 
  measurements and real-world impact. My work is 
  characterized by:

  - **Bi-Directional Knowledge Integration:**  
    I design neuro-symbolic AI frameworks where cognitive 
  science informs symbolic reasoning modules, and neural 
  network learning capabilities reciprocally enhance 
  cognitive understanding. My models feature *adaptive 
  integration weights* that dynamically balance 
  interpretability and learning, enabling real-time 
  adaptation to individual cognitive states—a capability not 
  achievable by single-discipline approaches.

  - **Methodological Convergence and Validation 
  Authenticity:**  
    My research creates genuine methodological convergence, 
  ensuring that each discipline’s methods transform the 
  other. I employ *multi-dimensional validation protocols* 
  that satisfy both computational efficiency metrics (e.g., 
  accuracy, inference time) and cognitive authenticity 
  measures (e.g., NASA-TLX cognitive load, behavioral pattern
   fidelity), ensuring solutions are both technically optimal
   and cognitively meaningful.

  - **Dynamic Trade-off Management:**  
    I address and transcend traditional trade-offs (e.g., 
  performance vs. interpretability, efficiency vs. cognitive 
  validity) by developing systems that dynamically adjust 
  their integration strategies based on real-time cognitive 
  load and task demands. This results in *Pareto-optimal 
  solutions* that outperform single-discipline baselines.

  - **Empirical Rigor and Transparent Failure 
  Documentation:**  
    My work is grounded in robust experimental design, 
  including power analysis, effect size reporting, and 
  multiple comparison corrections. I document not only 
  successful approaches but also cross-disciplinary 
  failures—attempts that succeed in one domain but fail 
  integration tests—advancing standards for transparency in 
  interdisciplinary science.

  - **Translational Impact:**  
    I translate these innovations into practical 
  applications, such as cognitive enhancement tools, 
  educational technology, and human-centered AI systems. For 
  example, my research on modeling surfboard-water 
  interactions with machine learning exemplifies how 
  data-driven insights can optimize both physical design and 
  user experience.

  - **Ethical and Open Science Practices:**  
    I prioritize IRB-approved protocols, data privacy, 
  informed consent, and open science practices, including 
  pre-registration and sharing of code and anonymized data.

  **Summary Statement:**  
  My research agenda is defined by a commitment to creating 
  genuinely novel, co-evolutionary methodologies that neither
   cognitive science nor AI could achieve alone. By 
  integrating rigorous empirical validation, dynamic 
  adaptation, and transparent reporting, I aim to advance 
  both theoretical understanding and practical solutions for 
  enhancing human cognition and learning.

  After reviewing the user's request and the provided draft 
  of Ryan Oates' full resume/CV, I have determined that there
   is sufficient information to create a detailed 
  step-by-step plan for finalizing and formatting the resume.
   The user has also posed a question regarding the preferred
   format and potential tailoring for specific applications, 
  which I will address in the plan. Below is a comprehensive 
  plan for an executor AI to follow in completing the task of
   preparing Ryan Oates' resume/CV.

  ### Step-by-Step Plan for Finalizing Ryan Oates' Resume/CV

  **Context for Executor AI:**  
  The user, Ryan Oates, requires a polished and 
  professionally formatted resume/CV that highlights their 
  interdisciplinary research identity at the intersection of 
  cognitive science and computational engineering. The draft 
  provided includes detailed sections on personal summary, 
  research goals, education, professional experience, 
  technical skills, publications, and more. The user has also
   inquired about specific formats (PDF, LaTeX, Word) and 
  tailoring for particular applications (academic, industry, 
  grant). This plan will guide the creation of the final 
  resume/CV document, ensuring it is formatted appropriately 
  and ready for distribution or customization.

  **Steps to Execute:**

  1. **Review and Finalize Content of the Draft Resume/CV**  
     - Use the provided draft as the base content for the 
  resume/CV. Ensure all sections (Header, Personal Summary, 
  Research Goals, Education, Professional Experience, 
  Research Focus, Technical Skills, Selected Publications, 
  Presentations & Workshops, Projects & Contributions, 
  Personal Approach, Interests & Activities, Professional 
  Affiliations, and Awards & Honors) are complete and 
  accurate.  
     - Check for consistency in formatting within the text 
  (e.g., bullet points, bolding, italics for emphasis) as per
   the draft structure.  
     - Note any placeholders or incomplete sections (e.g., 
  Awards & Honors marked as “Add as appropriate”) and leave 
  them as is unless specific content is provided later.

  2. **Create the Resume/CV in Microsoft Word Format (Primary
   Deliverable)**  
     - Use the `computercontroller__docx_tool` to create a 
  new Word document (.docx) for the resume/CV.  
       - Operation: `update_doc`  
       - Mode: `structured` (to maintain headings and 
  formatting)  
       - Content: Copy the entire draft content from the 
  user’s message into the document, preserving the structure 
  (headings, subheadings, bullet points, etc.).  
       - Path: Save as `Ryan_Oates_Resume.docx` in the 
  current workspace directory.  
     - Ensure proper formatting in Word:  
       - Use a professional font (e.g., Times New Roman or 
  Calibri, 11-12 pt for body text, 14-16 pt for headings).  
       - Set 1-inch margins on all sides.  
       - Align text appropriately (e.g., left-align body 
  text, center-align header with contact info).  
       - Add page numbers if the document exceeds one page.  
     - Save the document after formatting.

  3. **Convert the Word Document to PDF Format (Secondary 
  Deliverable)**  
     - Use the `computercontroller__pdf_tool` or an 
  appropriate shell command via `developer__shell` to convert
   the Word document to PDF.  
       - If using `developer__shell`, run a command like 
  `libreoffice --headless --convert-to pdf 
  Ryan_Oates_Resume.docx` (assuming LibreOffice is installed)
   or another conversion tool available in the environment.  
       - Save the output as `Ryan_Oates_Resume.pdf` in the 
  same workspace directory.  
     - Verify that the PDF retains the formatting from the 
  Word document (e.g., no text or layout distortions).

  4. **Prepare a LaTeX Version (Optional Deliverable for 
  Academic Use)**  
     - Use the `developer__text_editor` to create a LaTeX 
  file for the resume/CV, suitable for academic applications 
  where LaTeX is preferred.  
       - Command: `write`  
       - Path: `Ryan_Oates_Resume.tex`  
       - File Text: Use a standard LaTeX resume template 
  (e.g., `moderncv` or `article` class) and input the draft 
  content, adapting it to LaTeX syntax. Ensure sections are 
  properly formatted with LaTeX commands (e.g., `\section{}`,
   `\subsection{}`, itemize for bullet points).  
     - Use `developer__shell` to compile the LaTeX file into 
  a PDF.  
       - Command: `pdflatex Ryan_Oates_Resume.tex`  
       - Ensure the output `Ryan_Oates_Resume.pdf` (LaTeX 
  version) is saved in the workspace directory.  
     - Note: If LaTeX compilation fails due to missing 
  packages, notify the user of the issue and provide the 
  `.tex` file as is for manual compilation if needed.

  5. **Tailoring Guidance for Specific Applications**  
     - Prepare brief guidance notes (as a separate text file 
  or within a comment in the Word document) on how to tailor 
  the resume for different applications:  
       - **Academic Applications:** Emphasize the Research 
  Goals, Publications, and Presentations & Workshops 
  sections. Expand on research projects and methodological 
  rigor. Use the LaTeX or PDF version for submission.  
       - **Industry Applications:** Shorten the Research 
  Goals to the concise version provided in the draft. 
  Highlight Professional Experience and Technical Skills. 
  Focus on practical impacts (e.g., performance improvements,
   real-world applications). Use the Word or PDF version.  
       - **Grant Applications:** Focus on Research Goals, 
  Translational Impact, and Ethical Practices. Include 
  specific metrics (e.g., improvement percentages) and align 
  with grant objectives. Use the PDF version.  
     - Save this guidance as 
  `Ryan_Oates_Resume_Tailoring_Guide.txt` using 
  `developer__text_editor`.

  6. **Add Placeholder for Cover Letter (Optional)**  
     - In the Word document (`Ryan_Oates_Resume.docx`), add a
   note at the end or in a separate section stating: “Cover 
  Letter can be provided upon request or tailored for 
  specific applications.”  
     - Update the document using 
  `computercontroller__docx_tool` with this addition.

  7. **Verify and Save All Deliverables**  
     - Use `developer__shell` to list files in the workspace 
  directory and confirm that `Ryan_Oates_Resume.docx`, 
  `Ryan_Oates_Resume.pdf`, `Ryan_Oates_Resume.tex` (if 
  created), and `Ryan_Oates_Resume_Tailoring_Guide.txt` are 
  saved.  
       - Command: `ls -l`  
     - If any file is missing, repeat the relevant step to 
  recreate it.

  8. **Notify User of Completion and Deliverables**  
     - Prepare a summary message for the user indicating that
   the resume/CV has been finalized in multiple formats:  
       - Word Document: `Ryan_Oates_Resume.docx` (editable, 
  suitable for most applications).  
       - PDF: `Ryan_Oates_Resume.pdf` (for professional 
  submissions).  
       - LaTeX: `Ryan_Oates_Resume.tex` (optional, for 
  academic contexts, with compiled PDF if successful).  
       - Tailoring Guide: 
  `Ryan_Oates_Resume_Tailoring_Guide.txt` (instructions for 
  customizing the resume).  
     - Mention that the resume can be further tailored or 
  expanded (e.g., adding a cover letter or specific awards) 
  upon request.  
     - Use `memory__remember_memory` to store this summary 
  under:  
       - Category: `Resume_Deliverables`  
       - Data: The list of files and summary message.  
       - Tags: `resume, cv, ryan_oates`

  **Dependencies:**  
  - Step 2 must be completed before Step 3 (Word to PDF 
  conversion).  
  - Step 4 (LaTeX version) is optional and can be skipped if 
  LaTeX tools are unavailable or not required; however, 
  attempt it for completeness.  
  - Step 7 (verification) relies on successful completion of 
  Steps 2-6.

  **Conditional Logic:**  
  - If the LaTeX compilation in Step 4 fails due to 
  environment limitations (e.g., missing `pdflatex`), save 
  only the `.tex` file and note in the user summary that 
  manual compilation may be needed.  
  - If the user later specifies a preferred format or 
  application type, refer to the tailoring guide created in 
  Step 5 and adjust the relevant document accordingly.

  **Final Note for Executor AI:**  
  Ensure all files are saved in the user’s workspace 
  directory for easy access. If any tool fails to execute a 
  step (e.g., file creation or conversion issues), document 
  the error and proceed with the remaining steps, notifying 
  the user of any incomplete deliverables. The primary goal 
  is to deliver a polished resume/CV in at least Word and PDF
   formats, with guidance for tailoring to specific needs.

  This plan provides a clear path to finalize Ryan Oates' 
  resume/CV, addressing the user’s request for specific 
  formats and potential customization while leveraging the 
  available tools effectively.

  internships)?
  3. Develop a cover letter template?

  The current version maintains your unique interdisciplinary positioning while being
   grounded in realistic achievements for someone at your current stage.
