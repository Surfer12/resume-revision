  version of Ryan Oates' resume 
  using the `article` class with 
  custom formatting for a more 
  traditional academic CV look. 
  Below is the detailed plan for the
   executor AI to follow, including 
  all necessary context and actions.

  ---

  ### Step-by-Step Plan for Creating
   a LaTeX Version of Ryan Oates' 
  Resume

  **Context and Objective:**  
  The task is to create a LaTeX 
  version of Ryan Oates' resume, 
  focusing on interdisciplinary 
  research at the intersection of 
  cognitive science and 
  computational engineering. This 
  resume is intended for academic 
  applications where LaTeX-formatted
   documents are preferred for their
   professional typesetting. The 
  content includes specific 
  sections: Personal Summary, 
  Education, Research Interests, 
  Technical Skills, Personal 
  Projects, Paper Presentations, 
  Personal Approach, and Interests &
   Activities. The preferred LaTeX 
  class is `article` with custom 
  formatting to achieve a 
  traditional academic CV look, 
  emphasizing clarity and formality 
  suitable for academic purposes.

  **Tools to Use:**  
  - `developer__text_editor`: For 
  creating and writing the LaTeX 
  source code file.
  - `developer__shell`: For 
  potentially compiling the LaTeX 
  file into a PDF if needed (though 
  guidance on compilation will also 
  be provided to the user).

  **Detailed Steps:**

  1. **Create a New LaTeX File Using
   `article` Class with Custom 
  Formatting**  
     - Use the 
  `developer__text_editor` tool with
   the `write` command to create a 
  new file named 
  `ryan_oates_resume.tex`.  
     - Set up the document using the
   `article` class with custom 
  formatting to mimic a traditional 
  academic CV. Include packages for 
  better typography (`times` or 
  `palatino` for a formal font), 
  layout control (`geometry` for 
  margins), and section styling 
  (`titlesec` for customized 
  headings).  
     - Define a header with personal
   information (name, contact 
  details) and create placeholders 
  for all required sections: 
  Personal Summary, Education, 
  Research Interests, Technical 
  Skills, Personal Projects, Paper 
  Presentations, Personal Approach, 
  and Interests & Activities.  
     - **File Content Example (to be
   written):**  
       ```latex
       \documentclass[11pt,letterpap
  er]{article}
       \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
       \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
       \usepackage{palatino} % For a
   traditional, serif font
       
  \usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} 
  % Set 1-inch margins for a formal 
  look
       \usepackage{titlesec} % For 
  customizing section headings
       \usepackage{enumitem} % For 
  better list formatting
       \pagestyle{empty} % No page 
  numbers for a CV

       % Customize section headings 
  for a traditional academic look
       
  \titleformat{\section}{\large\bfse
  ries\raggedright}{}{0em}{}[\hrule]
       \titlespacing{\section}{0pt}{
  12pt}{6pt}

       % Define personal information
   header
       \begin{document}
       \begin{center}
           {\Huge Ryan Oates} \\
           \vspace{5pt}

       % Placeholder for content

       \section*{Interests \& 
  Activities}
       % Placeholder for content

       \end{document}
       ```

  2. **Populate the LaTeX File with 
  Resume Content**  
     - Use the 
  `developer__text_editor` tool with
   the `str_replace` command to 
  replace the placeholder comments 
  in each section with the actual 
  content from the enhanced resume 
  provided by the user.  
     - Format the content using 
  appropriate LaTeX structures, such
   as `itemize` or `description` 
  environments for lists, and ensure
   dates and other details are 
  aligned consistently for a 
  professional appearance (e.g., 
  using `\hfill` for right-aligned 
  dates).  
     - **Note:** If the exact 
  content text is not accessible in 
  the current context, extract it 
  from the user's previous message 
  or request it to be pasted again 
  for accuracy. Format the content 
  appropriately for LaTeX, escaping 
  special characters (e.g., `&`, 
  `%`, `) if necessary.  
     - **Dependency:** This step 
  relies on having the exact resume 
  content. If unavailable, the 
  executor AI should note this and 
  proceed with placeholders, 
  informing the user to fill in the 
  content manually or provide it for
   updating.

  3. **Refine Layout and Formatting 
  for Traditional Academic Style**  
     - Use the 
  `developer__text_editor` tool with
   the `str_replace` or `write` 
  command to ensure the formatting 
  aligns with a traditional academic
   CV aesthetic. This includes:
       - Using a serif font like 
  Palatino or Times for a formal 
  look.
       - Ensuring section headings 
  are clear and separated by 
  horizontal rules (as defined in 
  Step 1).
       - Adjusting spacing between 
  entries using `enumitem` package 
  settings (e.g., 
  `\setlist[itemize]{itemsep=2pt}`) 
  for a compact yet readable layout.
     - Verify that the document 
  avoids modern or overly stylized 
  elements, focusing on simplicity 
  and professionalism.

  4. **Add Compilation Guidance as a
   Comment in the File**  
     - Use the 
  `developer__text_editor` tool to 
  append a comment at the top of 
  `ryan_oates_resume.tex` with 
  instructions for the user on how 
  to compile the LaTeX file into a 
  PDF.  
     - **Comment Example to Add:**  
       ```latex
       % Compilation Instructions:
       % 1. Use an online LaTeX 
  editor like Overleaf 
  (www.overleaf.com) by uploading 
  this file.
       % 2. Alternatively, install a
   local LaTeX distribution such as 
  TeX Live (Linux/Mac) or MiKTeX 
  (Windows).
       % 3. Compile the document 
  using a LaTeX editor (e.g., 
  TeXShop, TeXworks) or command line
   with: pdflatex 
  ryan_oates_resume.tex
       % 4. Ensure necessary 
  packages (palatino, titlesec, 
  enumitem, geometry) are installed 
  in your LaTeX environment.
       ```

  5. **Optional: Attempt Local 
  Compilation (if feasible)**  
     - If the environment supports 
  LaTeX compilation, use the 
  `developer__shell` tool to run a 
  command like `pdflatex 
  ryan_oates_resume.tex` to generate
   `ryan_oates_resume.pdf`.  
     - Check for errors in the 
  output and note them for the user 
  if compilation fails (e.g., 
  missing packages).  
     - **Conditional Logic:** If 
  compilation is not supported or 
  fails, skip this step and inform 
  the user that they will need to 
  compile the file themselves using 
  the provided instructions.  
     - **Command Example:** 
  `pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex`

  6. **Deliver the LaTeX Source File
   and Instructions to the User**  
     - Inform the user that the 
  LaTeX source file 
  `ryan_oates_resume.tex` has been 
  created and is ready for use, 
  formatted with the `article` class
   for a traditional academic CV 
  look.  
     - If a PDF was successfully 
  generated in Step 5, mention the 
  availability of 
  `ryan_oates_resume.pdf`. 
  Otherwise, reiterate the 
  compilation instructions added in 
  Step 4.  
     - Provide a brief note on how 
  to customize the file further if 
  needed (e.g., changing the font to
   `times` by replacing `palatino` 
  with `times` in the preamble, or 
  adjusting margins via the 
  `geometry` package).

  **Additional Notes for Executor 
  AI:**  
  - Ensure all special characters in
   the resume content are properly 
  escaped for LaTeX (e.g., replace 
  `&` with `\&`, `%` with `\%`, 
  etc.).  
  - If there are issues accessing 
  the exact content from the user's 
  previous message, note this 
  limitation and leave detailed 
  placeholders with instructions for
   the user to fill in.  
  - If specific LaTeX packages 
  (e.g., `palatino`, `titlesec`) are
   not available in the user’s 
  environment, consider using 
  alternatives (e.g., `times` 
  instead of `palatino`) and update 
  the file accordingly, noting this 
  in the instructions.
