### Step-by-Step Plan for Creating a LaTeX Version of Ryan Oates' Resume

**Context and Objective:**  
The task is to create a LaTeX version of Ryan Oates' resume, focusing on interdisciplinary research at the intersection of cognitive science and computational engineering. This resume is intended for academic applications where LaTeX-formatted documents are preferred for their professional typesetting. The content includes specific sections: Personal Summary, Education, Research Interests, Technical Skills, Personal Projects, Paper Presentations, Personal Approach, and Interests & Activities. The preferred LaTeX class is `article` with custom formatting to achieve a traditional academic CV look, emphasizing clarity and formality suitable for academic purposes.

**Tools to Use:**  
- `developer__text_editor`: For creating and writing the LaTeX source code file.
- `developer__shell`: For potentially compiling the LaTeX file into a PDF if needed (though guidance on compilation will also be provided to the user).

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Create a New LaTeX File Using `article` Class with Custom Formatting**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `write` command to create a new file named `ryan_oates_resume.tex`.  
   - Set up the document using the `article` class with custom formatting to mimic a traditional academic CV. Include packages for better typography (`times` or `palatino` for a formal font), layout control (`geometry` for margins), and section styling (`titlesec` for customized headings).  
   - Define a header with personal information (name, contact details) and create placeholders for all required sections: Personal Summary, Education, Research Interests, Technical Skills, Personal Projects, Paper Presentations, Personal Approach, and Interests & Activities.  
   - **File Content Example (to be written):**  
     ```latex
     \documentclass[11pt,letterpaper]{article}
     \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
     \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
     \usepackage{palatino} % For a traditional, serif font
     \usepackage[margin=1in]{geometry} % Set 1-inch margins for a formal look
     \usepackage{titlesec} % For customizing section headings
     \usepackage{enumitem} % For better list formatting
     \pagestyle{empty} % No page numbers for a CV

     % Customize section headings for a traditional academic look
     \titleformat{\section}{\large\bfseries\raggedright}{}{0em}{}[\hrule]
     \titlespacing{\section}{0pt}{12pt}{6pt}

     % Define personal information header
     \begin{document}
     \begin{center}
         {\Huge Ryan Oates} \\
         \vspace{5pt}
         123 Academic Lane, Research City, RC 45678 | +1-234-567-8901 | ryan.oates@email.com | www.ryanoates.com
     \end{center}
     \vspace{10pt}

     \section*{Personal Summary}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section*{Education}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section*{Research Interests}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section*{Technical Skills}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section*{Personal Projects}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section*{Paper Presentations}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section*{Personal Approach}
     % Placeholder for content

     \section*{Interests \& Activities}
     % Placeholder for content

     \end{document}
     ```

2. **Populate the LaTeX File with Resume Content**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `str_replace` command to replace the placeholder comments in each section with the actual content from the enhanced resume provided by the user.  
   - Format the content using appropriate LaTeX structures, such as `itemize` or `description` environments for lists, and ensure dates and other details are aligned consistently for a professional appearance (e.g., using `\hfill` for right-aligned dates).  
   - **Note:** If the exact content text is not accessible in the current context, extract it from the user's previous message or request it to be pasted again for accuracy. Format the content appropriately for LaTeX, escaping special characters (e.g., `&`, `%`, `$`) if necessary.  
   - **Dependency:** This step relies on having the exact resume content. If unavailable, the executor AI should note this and proceed with placeholders, informing the user to fill in the content manually or provide it for updating.

3. **Refine Layout and Formatting for Traditional Academic Style**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool with the `str_replace` or `write` command to ensure the formatting aligns with a traditional academic CV aesthetic. This includes:
     - Using a serif font like Palatino or Times for a formal look.
     - Ensuring section headings are clear and separated by horizontal rules (as defined in Step 1).
     - Adjusting spacing between entries using `enumitem` package settings (e.g., `\setlist[itemize]{itemsep=2pt}`) for a compact yet readable layout.
   - Verify that the document avoids modern or overly stylized elements, focusing on simplicity and professionalism.

4. **Add Compilation Guidance as a Comment in the File**  
   - Use the `developer__text_editor` tool to append a comment at the top of `ryan_oates_resume.tex` with instructions for the user on how to compile the LaTeX file into a PDF.  
   - **Comment Example to Add:**  
     ```latex
     % Compilation Instructions:
     % 1. Use an online LaTeX editor like Overleaf (www.overleaf.com) by uploading this file.
     % 2. Alternatively, install a local LaTeX distribution such as TeX Live (Linux/Mac) or MiKTeX (Windows).
     % 3. Compile the document using a LaTeX editor (e.g., TeXShop, TeXworks) or command line with: pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex
     % 4. Ensure necessary packages (palatino, titlesec, enumitem, geometry) are installed in your LaTeX environment.
     ```

5. **Optional: Attempt Local Compilation (if feasible)**  
   - If the environment supports LaTeX compilation, use the `developer__shell` tool to run a command like `pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex` to generate `ryan_oates_resume.pdf`.  
   - Check for errors in the output and note them for the user if compilation fails (e.g., missing packages).  
   - **Conditional Logic:** If compilation is not supported or fails, skip this step and inform the user that they will need to compile the file themselves using the provided instructions.  
   - **Command Example:** `pdflatex ryan_oates_resume.tex`

6. **Deliver the LaTeX Source File and Instructions to the User**  
   - Inform the user that the LaTeX source file `ryan_oates_resume.tex` has been created and is ready for use, formatted with the `article` class for a traditional academic CV look.  
   - If a PDF was successfully generated in Step 5, mention the availability of `ryan_oates_resume.pdf`. Otherwise, reiterate the compilation instructions added in Step 4.  
   - Provide a brief note on how to customize the file further if needed (e.g., changing the font to `times` by replacing `palatino` with `times` in the preamble, or adjusting margins via the `geometry` package).

**Additional Notes for Executor AI:**  
- Ensure all special characters in the resume content are properly escaped for LaTeX (e.g., replace `&` with `\&`, `%` with `\%`, etc.).  
- If there are issues accessing the exact content from the user's previous message, note this limitation and leave detailed placeholders with instructions for the user to fill in.  
- If specific LaTeX packages (e.g., `palatino`, `titlesec`) are not available in the user’s environment, consider using alternatives (e.g., `times` instead of `palatino`) and update the file accordingly, noting this in the instructions.

This plan provides a clear path to create a professional LaTeX resume for Ryan Oates using the `article` class with custom formatting for a traditional academic CV look, ensuring it meets the needs for academic applications. The executor AI should follow these steps precisely, using the specified tools and handling any conditional scenarios as outlined.
