The key changes I made:
1. Removed the fontspec package which requires XeLaTeX or 
LuaLaTeX
2. Removed the \setmainfont{Times New Roman} line that was 
causing the error
3. Kept all the other formatting and content intact

This version should compile correctly with pdfLaTeX. If you
're using a system like Overleaf, you can also simply 
change the compiler from pdfLaTeX to XeLaTeX in the 
settings to use the original code.

Would you like me to make any other adjustments to the 
LaTeX code, or would you like additional guidance on 
compiling it?

   - Use `memory__remember_memory` to store initial talking points for technical deep dive, research process, and impact/applications as outlined by the user.
   - Parameters: `category: Interview Talking Points`, `data: [list of talking points from outline]`, `is_global: false`.
   - Update these points using feedback from mock interviews or applications by editing stored memories with `memory__retrieve_memories` and `developer__text_editor` for documentation.

9. **Expand Application Examples in Materials**
   - As new application examples develop, integrate them into the portfolio, GitHub repository, and resume using `developer__text_editor` and `developer__shell` for GitHub updates.
   - **Dependency**: Wait for user input or memory updates under "Application Examples" category before proceeding.

#### Phase 4: Cover Letter Integration
10. **Prepare Tailored Cover Letter Templates**
    - Use `computercontroller__docx_tool` to create three cover letter templates (for Academic, Industry, and Research Lab positions) with the specified points from the outline.
    - Content for each:
      - **Academic**: Highlight research rigor, statistical validity, transparency, methodological innovations, and interdisciplinary approach.
      - **Industry**: Emphasize practical applications, performance optimization, efficiency improvements, and framework design.
      - **Research Lab**: Focus on methodological contributions, novel regularization, architectural innovations, benchmarking, and open science.
    - Parameters: `operation: update_doc`, `path: [path to cover letter templates]`, `content: [specific content for each template]`, `params: mode=structured`.
    - **Dependency**: If paths are unknown, locate or create new DOCX files using `developer__shell`.

#### Phase 5: Documentation and Storage
11. **Store Plan and Progress for Future Reference**
    - Use `memory__remember_memory` to store the entire plan and progress updates for future reference by the user or other AI agents.
    - Parameters: `category: Resume Integration Plan`, `data: [full plan text and status updates]`, `is_global: false`, `tags: resume, research, integration`.

**Final Notes for Executor AI**:
- Ensure all file paths are confirmed or located using available tools before proceeding with edits.
- If any step encounters an issue (e.g., missing files, login requirements), pause and prompt the user for clarification or assistance using the appropriate tool or memory storage for tracking unresolved issues.
- Maintain a log of completed steps using `memory__remember_memory` under category "Integration Progress" to track what has been done and what remains.
- Adhere to the timeline provided (immediate updates in 1-2 days, short-term in 1-2 weeks, ongoing as needed) unless instructed otherwise by the user.
