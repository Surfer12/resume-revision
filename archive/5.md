## PERSONAL SUMMARY

Interdisciplinary researcher at the intersection of cognitive science and computational engineering. Passionate about developing methodologies for studying individual personality types and perceptions through observable and scientifically verifiable measurements. Experienced in modeling physical systems (e.g., surfboard-water interactions) using machine learning to enhance design and performance. Committed to ethical technology development and promoting neurodiversity in innovation.

---

## RESEARCH GOALS

I develop and validate interdisciplinary methodologies that bridge cognitive science and artificial intelligence, with a focus on observable, scientifically verifiable measurements and real-world impact. My work is characterized by:

- **Bi-Directional Knowledge Integration:**  
  Designing neuro-symbolic AI frameworks where cognitive science informs symbolic reasoning modules, and neural network learning capabilities reciprocally enhance cognitive understanding. My models feature *adaptive integration weights* that dynamically balance interpretability and learning, enabling real-time adaptation to individual cognitive states—a capability not achievable by single-discipline approaches.

- **Methodological Convergence and Validation Authenticity:**  
  Creating genuine methodological convergence, ensuring that each discipline’s methods transform the other. Employing *multi-dimensional validation protocols* that satisfy both computational efficiency metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference time) and cognitive authenticity measures (e.g., NASA-TLX cognitive load, behavioral pattern fidelity).

- **Dynamic Trade-off Management:**  
  Developing systems that dynamically adjust their integration strategies based on real-time cognitive load and task demands, resulting in *Pareto-optimal solutions* that outperform single-discipline baselines.

- **Empirical Rigor and Transparent Failure Documentation:**  
  Grounded in robust experimental design, including power analysis, effect size reporting, and multiple comparison corrections. Documenting not only successful approaches but also cross-disciplinary failures—advancing standards for transparency in interdisciplinary science.

- **Translational Impact:**  
  Translating innovations into practical applications, such as cognitive enhancement tools, educational technology, and human-centered AI systems. For example, research on modeling surfboard-water interactions with machine learning exemplifies how data-driven insights can optimize both physical design and user experience.

- **Ethical and Open Science Practices:**  
  Prioritizing IRB-approved protocols, data privacy, informed consent, and open science practices, including pre-registration and sharing of code and anonymized data.

## PERSONAL SUMMARY

Interdisciplinary researcher at the intersection of cognitive science and computational engineering. Passionate about developing methodologies for studying individual personality types and perceptions through observable and scientifically verifiable measurements. Experienced in modeling physical systems (e.g., surfboard-water interactions) using machine learning to enhance design and performance. Committed to ethical technology development and promoting neurodiversity in innovation.

---

## RESEARCH GOALS

I develop and validate interdisciplinary methodologies that bridge cognitive science and artificial intelligence, with a focus on observable, scientifically verifiable measurements and real-world impact. My work is characterized by:

- **Bi-Directional Knowledge Integration:**  
  Designing neuro-symbolic AI frameworks where cognitive science informs symbolic reasoning modules, and neural network learning capabilities reciprocally enhance cognitive understanding. My models feature *adaptive integration weights* that dynamically balance interpretability and learning, enabling real-time adaptation to individual cognitive states—a capability not achievable by single-discipline approaches.

- **Methodological Convergence and Validation Authenticity:**  
  Creating genuine methodological convergence, ensuring that each discipline’s methods transform the other. Employing *multi-dimensional validation protocols* that satisfy both computational efficiency metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference time) and cognitive authenticity measures (e.g., NASA-TLX cognitive load, behavioral pattern fidelity).

- **Dynamic Trade-off Management:**  
  Developing systems that dynamically adjust their integration strategies based on real-time cognitive load and task demands, resulting in *Pareto-optimal solutions* that outperform single-discipline baselines.

- **Empirical Rigor and Transparent Failure Documentation:**  
  Grounded in robust experimental design, including power analysis, effect size reporting, and multiple comparison corrections. Documenting not only successful approaches but also cross-disciplinary failures—advancing standards for transparency in interdisciplinary science.

- **Translational Impact:**  
  Translating innovations into practical applications, such as cognitive enhancement tools, educational technology, and human-centered AI systems. For example, research on modeling surfboard-water interactions with machine learning exemplifies how data-driven insights can optimize both physical design and user experience.

- **Ethical and Open Science Practices:**  
  Prioritizing IRB-approved protocols, data privacy, informed consent, and open science practices, including pre-registration and sharing of code and anonymized data.

My models feature *adaptive integration weights* that dynamically balance interpretability and learning, enabling real-time adaptation to individual cognitive states—a capability not achievable by single-discipline approaches.

- **Methodological Convergence and Validation Authenticity:**  
  My research creates genuine methodological convergence, ensuring that each discipline’s methods transform the other. I employ *multi-dimensional validation protocols* that satisfy both computational efficiency metrics (e.g., accuracy, inference time) and cognitive authenticity measures (e.g., NASA-TLX cognitive load, behavioral pattern fidelity), ensuring solutions are both technically optimal and cognitively meaningful.

- **Dynamic Trade-off Management:**  
  I address and transcend traditional trade-offs (e.g., performance vs. interpretability, efficiency vs. cognitive validity) by developing systems that dynamically adjust their integration strategies based on real-time cognitive load and task demands. This results in *Pareto-optimal solutions* that outperform single-discipline baselines.

- **Empirical Rigor and Transparent Failure Documentation:**  
  My work is grounded in robust experimental design, including power analysis, effect size reporting, and multiple comparison corrections. I document not only successful approaches but also cross-disciplinary failures—attempts that succeed in one domain but fail integration tests—advancing standards for transparency in interdisciplinary science.

- **Translational Impact:**  
  I translate these innovations into practical applications, such as cognitive enhancement tools, educational technology, and human-centered AI systems. For example, my research on modeling surfboard-water interactions with machine learning exemplifies how data-driven insights can optimize both physical design and user experience.

- **Ethical and Open Science Practices:**  
  I prioritize IRB-approved protocols, data privacy, informed consent, and open science practices, including pre-registration and sharing of code and anonymized data.

**Summary Statement:**  
My research agenda is defined by a commitment to creating genuinely novel, co-evolutionary methodologies that neither cognitive science nor AI could achieve alone. By integrating rigorous empirical validation, dynamic adaptation, and transparent reporting, I aim to advance both theoretical understanding and practical solutions for enhancing human cognition and learning.

### How This Section Embodies Your Unique Interdisciplinary Approach

- **Not Just “Interdisciplinary” in Name:**  
  You demonstrate *methodological convergence*—your work is not simply the sum of two fields, but a new synthesis where each discipline’s methods and standards transform the other.
- **Bidirectional Integration:**  
  Your frameworks allow cognitive science to shape AI architectures (e.g., symbolic reasoning modules, cognitive-inspired regularization in deep learning) and, reciprocally, use AI to probe and extend cognitive theory.
- **Multi-Dimensional Validation:**  
  You set a new standard by requiring that your solutions meet both technical (accuracy, efficiency) and cognitive (authenticity, load, behavioral fidelity) benchmarks.
- **Transparent Failure Reporting:**  
  You document not only technical failures but also “integration failures”—where approaches succeed in one domain but fail when cross-validated against the standards of another. This is a methodological innovation in itself.
- **Dynamic Trade-off Management:**  
  Your models do not statically balance performance and interpretability; they *adapt* based on real-time cognitive context, a feature not found in traditional approaches.
- **Quantified Synergy:**  
  You provide evidence that your integrated approaches achieve performance improvements that exceed the sum of single-discipline optimizations (e.g., 18% improvement in cognitive task performance vs. 3–8% for single-discipline models).
- **Ethical and Open Science Leadership:**  
  You foreground IRB approval, data privacy, and open science, positioning yourself as a leader in responsible, transparent research.
